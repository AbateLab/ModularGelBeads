# ModularGelBeads

These scripts were used for the preparation of the paper: "Modular barcode beads for microfluidic single-cell genomics", and can be used to reproduce the figures.

Scripts corresponding to the fabrication and use of modular barcode beads for single cell experiments (single cell RNA sequencing or single cell amplicon sequencing) can be found in the respective subfolders. Jupyter noteboks on the use of the scripts are provided.

These scripts use the external programs: Cutadapt (https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), Kallisto/bustools (https://www.kallistobus.tools/) and use the Scanpy (https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library for visualization.
